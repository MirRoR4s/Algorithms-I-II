Thanks for **enrolling**（参加） in our course Algorithms, Part I. You can review the [syllabus（教学大纲）](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/resources/CrmR4) for an overview of the course components. The course is based on a variety of material that we have prepared over many years:

- The lecture videos, lecture slides, programming assignments, and "job interview" questions will be released weekly on the course website.

- Our textbook [Algorithms, 4th edition](http://amzn.to/13VLlYJ) is the basic （参考书目） for the material we will be covering. Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we will assign optional readings for students who wish more extensive coverage of the material.

- Our [booksite](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/), which is open to everyone and contains a wealth of supplementary information, including **synopses**（梗概） of the textbook and Java code that you will be using throughout the course.

To maximize your chance of success in this course, you should get in the mindset of being an *active* participant who writes and debugs code, solves problems, studies the available resources, and engages in the discussion forums, as opposed to a *passive* participant who just watches the lectures. You'll get a good feeling for the spirit and pace of the course when you work on the first programming assignment, which will introduce you to our Java programming model in the context of an important scientific application.
